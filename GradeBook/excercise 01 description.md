# Exercise 01

## Concepts

+ Git
+ Visual Studio
+ Class libraries
+ Unit tests
+ OOP

## Instructions

Please create a class library that solves the following problem. We should be able to follow your work via git commits. You should also write unit tests that execute your class library and following good testing procedures to increase your code coverage. Note you do not need a database for this exercise.

Please create the git repository under your personal account as opposed to under the developer foundry organization.

Please complete the project as best you can by Thursday. We will do different tasks with this code Thursday.

## Problem

Please create an grade book application for teachers. You should have objects and tests that represent students, assessments (pop quizzes, quizzes, tests, and finals), and the grade book itself. The grade book should support the following operations:

+ Highest score
+ Median score
+ Average score
+ Final grade calculation

Note there are different assessment types. 

+ A final is weighted at 50% of the final grade (assume exactly one final)
+ A test is worth 20% of the final grade (assume exactly two tests)
+ A quiz is worth 10% of the final grade (assume exactly two quizzes)
+ A pop quiz is worth 2% of the final grade (assume exactly 5 pop quizzes)

Note there are three different types of students.

+ Special needs students final score is only made up of pop quizzes, quizzes, and tests. Their final does not count.
+ Advanced students final score is only based on their final exam.
+ Regular students are graded  as described above under assessment types.
